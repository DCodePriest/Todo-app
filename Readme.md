Certainly! Here's an explanation of each part of the code:

const express = require("express")
const app = express()

app.use(express.json())

let tasks = []

This sets up the Express application, including loading the express module, creating a new Express app, and creating an empty tasks array to hold our to-do list items.

app.get("/tasks", (req, res) => {
  res.json(tasks)
})


This sets up an endpoint for getting all the to-do list items (/tasks). When a client makes a GET request to this endpoint, the server responds with the tasks array as a JSON object.


app.post("/tasks", (req, res) => {
  const task = req.body.task
  tasks.push({task: task, completed: false})
  res.status(201).json({message: "Task added successfully"})
})


This sets up an endpoint for adding a new to-do list item (/tasks). When a client makes a POST request to this endpoint, the server reads the task description from the request body (req.body.task) and adds it to the tasks array. The server then responds with a status code of 201 (indicating success) and a JSON object containing a success message.

app.put("/tasks/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id
  if (tasks[id]) {
    tasks[id].completed = true
    res.json({message: "Task marked as complete"})
  } else {
    res.status(404).json({message: "Task not found"})
  }
})


This sets up an endpoint for marking a task as complete (/tasks/:id). When a client makes a PUT request to this endpoint with a specific task ID, the server looks up the task in the tasks array by index (req.params.id). If the task is found, the server marks the task as completed and responds with a JSON object containing a success message. If the task is not found, the server responds with a status code of 404 (indicating not found) and a JSON object containing an error message.


app.delete("/tasks/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id
  if (tasks[id]) {
    tasks.splice(id, 1)
    res.status(204).json({message: "Task deleted successfully"})
  } else {
    res.status(404).json({message: "Task not found"})
  }
})


This sets up an endpoint for deleting a task (/tasks/:id). When a client makes a DELETE request to this endpoint with a specific task ID, the server looks up the task in the tasks array by index (req.params.id). If the task is found, the server removes the task from the tasks array and responds with a status code of 204 (indicating success but with no content) and a JSON object containing a success message. If the task is not found, the server responds with a status code of 404 (indicating not found) and a JSON object containing an error message.


app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 3000")
})


This starts the server and listens for incoming requests on port 3000. When the server starts, it prints a message to the console indicating that it's running.

Overall, this code sets up a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. The server communicates with clients using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
